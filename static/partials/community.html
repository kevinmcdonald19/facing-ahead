        </div>
        <p class="why_title">Commitment</p>
        <p class="why_body">Too many movies, love songs, and TV shows reflect the notion that love is a feeling rather than a decision. This section has to do with choosing to love even when it might be difficult. Commitment is an agreement or a pledge to do something in the future, even when we may or may not feel like doing so. We act according to our agreement. Marriage represents such a commitment. We decide to love, with or without the loving feelings. What we also know about such a pledge is that when we do act based upon one's commitment we can create an atmosphere where the positive and loving feelings can more likely flourish.</p>
